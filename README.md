# SBI Performance Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This dashboard was created as part of a **one-hour project workshop** conducted by **Entri Elevate**. The project aimed to analyze the **financial performance, customer satisfaction**, and **digital transformation** of the State Bank of India (SBI) across various states. Despite the time constraint, the dashboard presents valuable insights through its use of Power BI visualizations and interactive elements.

## Key Features:
1. **Financial Performance**:
   - Displays **total turnover**, **deposits**, and **net profit** for key states such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and West Bengal.
   
2. **Digital Transformation**:
   - Highlights the **number of ATMs** and the percentage of digital transactions in different states to show SBI's digital initiatives.

3. **Customer Satisfaction**:
   - A **donut chart** visualizes customer satisfaction rates in various states.

4. **Profit Per Month**:
   - Shows monthly profit trends in different states.

5. **Total Employees by City**:
   - A map that visualizes the number of SBI employees across different cities in India.

## Challenges & Solutions:
- **Time Constraint**: The dashboard was developed within a tight one-hour deadline, pushing us to focus on key metrics and insights.
- **Data Similarity**: One of the major challenges was working with data where the profits, revenue, and other metrics were very similar across multiple regions. To handle this, we used distinct visual elements and charts to highlight small differences, ensuring the insights were still clear and informative.

## Tools & Techniques:
- **Power BI**: Data modeling and visualizations.
- **DAX**: Calculated fields and measures for net profit and turnover.
- **Interactive Filters**: Allow users to drill down into specific financial years and regions for a detailed analysis.

## Dataset:
The dataset contains financial performance metrics from **2019 to 2024** across five Indian states and includes information about total turnover, deposits, net profit, number of ATMs, and customer satisfaction.

## Purpose:
The dashboard is designed to assist decision-makers in visualizing SBI's financial and operational performance across states, helping to highlight trends in **digital transformation** and **customer satisfaction**.

## Future Enhancements:
- Expanding the dataset to include more states.
- Adding additional KPIs to provide further insights.
- Enhancing the interactivity of the dashboard with more advanced Power BI features.

## How to Use:
1. Download the `.pbix` file from this repository.
2. Open the file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Use the interactive filters on the left side of the dashboard to explore financial data by year.
4. Drill down into the map to view the employee distribution across Indian cities.
